                <li>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs, 
				develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It is considered one of the Big Tech 
				technology companies, alongside Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Facebook.[6][7][8]</li>

                <li>The company's hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal 
				computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, 
				the AirPods wireless earbuds and the HomePod smart speaker. Apple's software includes macOS, iOS, iPadOS, 
				watchOS, and tvOS operating systems, the iTunes media player, the Safari web browser, the Shazam music identifier, 
				and the iLife and iWork creativity and productivity suites, as well as professional applications like Final Cut Pro, 
				Logic Pro, and Xcode. Its online services include the iTunes Store, the iOS App Store, Mac App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, 
				iMessage, and iCloud. Other services include Apple Store, Genius Bar, AppleCare, Apple Pay, Apple Pay Cash, and Apple Card.</li>
                <li>Apple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in April 1976 to develop and sell Wozniak's 
				Apple I personal computer, though Wayne sold his share back within 12 days. It was incorporated as Apple Computer, Inc., 
				in January 1977, and sales of its computers, including the Apple II, grew quickly. Within a few years, Jobs and Wozniak 
				had hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line. Apple went public in 1980 to instant financial success. 
				Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original 
				Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, 
				the high price of its products and limited application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. 
				In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple amicably and remained an honorary employee,[9] while Jobs and others resigned to found NeXT.[10]</li>
				<li>Apple Computer Company was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne as a business 
				partnership.[17][20] The company's first product was the Apple I, a computer designed and hand-built entirely by Wozniak,
				[21][22] and first shown to the public at the Homebrew Computer Club.[23][24] Apple I was sold as a motherboard (with CPU, 
				RAM, and basic textual-video chips)â€”a base kit concept which would now not be marketed as a complete personal computer.[25] 
				The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 and was market-priced at $666.66 ($2,995 in 2019 dollars, adjusted for inflation).
				[26][27][28][29][30][31]:180 Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, 
				and that he came up with the price because he liked "repeating digits".</li>
